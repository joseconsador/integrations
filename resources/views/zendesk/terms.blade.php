        <p>This Built by Zendesk Application Agreement (“Agreement”) is made between Zendesk, Inc. and its Affiliates, including without limitation Zendesk Singapore Pte Ltd and We Are Cloud SAS,  (collectively, “Zendesk”) and You. By accepting this Agreement or by using the
        Application (as defined below), You represent and acknowledge that You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement as it governs Your use of and access to the Application. The Application made available to You pursuant to this Agreement may only be
        utilized and tested in association with a subscription to a Service provided by Zendesk to You  (as those terms are defined in the Master Subscription Agreement available at https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/#master-subscription-agreement (the “MSA”)).
        Your use of a Service provided by Zendesk shall be governed by the MSA. Your use of the Application shall be governed by this Agreement. By entering into this Agreement, You represent and warrant that You have the authority to bind the owner, and all Agents authorized
        under the account for the Service (the “Account”) to the Agreement. If the Account is owned, controlled or operated by or on behalf of a company or another legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this Agreement,
        in which case the terms “You” shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree to the terms herein, You must not accept this Agreement or use the integration. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined
        herein shall have the meaning set forth in the MSA. </p>

        <p> <b>1. Scope of Agreement </b> You are being invited by Zendesk to access and use an application developed by Zendesk that utilizes and interacts with the API and a third party service (“Third Party Service”) provided by a third party (“Third Party”) in connection with Your

        and includes any ancillary products and services that the Third Party provides to You. Zendesk shall retain sole and absolute discretion as to whether the Application will be made available to You. You are not required to utilize or enable the Application, but if You
        elect to do so, Your use of and access to the Application shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Zendesk may charge for use and access to the Application or may provide the Application for no charge. Zendesk reserves the right to start charging or revise fee
        amounts at any time, at its sole discretion, under this Agreement or after the Application is incorporated into the Service. You acknowledge that Your use of the Application is governed by this Agreement and that the MSA (including any terms related to
        Deployed Associated Services) does not apply to the Application. </p>
